# Titanic-Survivors-ML

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for the classic Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict passenger survival based on demographic and travel-related features. The project includes data exploration, feature engineering, visualization, and model development using multiple machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn.

Given the dataset’s challenges — including a limited number of samples and significant class imbalance — careful feature selection and model tuning were essential. After extensive experimentation, several combinations of features were found to complement each other effectively, with Random Forest emerging as the best-performing model. This approach achieved over 81% accuracy, placing the submission in the top 2% of the Kaggle leaderboard.

There remains potential for further improvement, with top leaderboard scores reaching around 85%. Enhancements could include exploring additional feature engineering strategies, identifying better variable combinations, or testing more advanced models. Despite its apparent simplicity, the Titanic dataset provides an excellent opportunity to practice end-to-end machine learning workflows and to deepen understanding of predictive modeling in the presence of limited and imbalanced data.
